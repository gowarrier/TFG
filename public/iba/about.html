            <p>The Investment Banking Academy is dedicated to providing CMU students with the resources necessary to obtain internships and full-time positions within investment banking. Members go through a training program about a career in IB with a focus on industry knowledge, networking, resume/cover letter review, and technical/behavioral interview preparation. In addition, the clubâ€™s more experienced members actively provide mentorship and guidance to the younger members. 

            Since our founding in early 2014, we have placed 100% of our members into front-office positions within major investment banks and boutiques on Wall Street. Firms represented by IBA members include Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan, Evercore, Citi, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Credit Suisse, Jefferies, and PNC.
