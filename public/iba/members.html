            </h1>
            <p>The Investment Banking Academy is dedicated to providing CMU students with the resources necessary to obtain internships and full-time positions within investment banking. Members go through a training program about a career in IB with a focus on industry knowledge, networking, resume/cover letter review, and technical/behavioral interview preparation. In addition, the clubâ€™s more experienced members actively provide mentorship and guidance to the younger members. 

            Since our founding in early 2014, we have placed 100% of our members into front-office positions within major investment banks and boutiques on Wall Street. Firms represented by IBA members include Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan, Evercore, Citi, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Credit Suisse, Jefferies, and PNC.

            <p>TFG aims to foster a collaborative community for CMU students interested in finance and realize synergies from the combined clubs. We hold regular general body meetings, bring in guest speakers including local finance professionals and alumni, host case competitions, provide mentorship from older members, and maintain a mutually beneficial relationship with CMU alumni working in finance.

            The TFG umbrella clubs operate with their own objectives and activities, while still collectively contributing to the good of the overall TFG community. TFG was founded in the spring of 2016 by the presidents of IFS (formerly the Undergraduate Finance Association), TSF, and IBA/STA (formerly the Wall Street Club).

                <small>Why TFG?</small>
            </h1>
            <p>Prior the Spring of 2016, the divisions of TFG operated independently. While each club enjoyed success on their own, it became clear there were inefficiencies in terms of overlapping events, external confusion and minimal collaboration between the clubs. The merger was initiated to maximize the coordination and collaboration between the CMU finance community and best equip its member students for futures in finance.</p>
